Introduction:
	1.main.m is the tesing program
	2.prediction.m is the model function
	3.obj.m is the objective function(SSE for Ct)

Software:
	MATLAB/OCTAVE
	
Purpose:
                Task 2 aims to build up a model with only confirmed cases data.
		
Outcome:
                After running main.m, MATLAB will open a figure window and plot the SIR model curve.
		
Note:
	Don't move the data file casually
