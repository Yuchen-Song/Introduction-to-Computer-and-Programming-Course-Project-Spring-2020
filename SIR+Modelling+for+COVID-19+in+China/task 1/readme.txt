Introduction:
	1.main.m is the tesing program
	2.model.m is the model function

Software:
	MATLAB/OCTAVE
	
Purpose:
                Task 1 aims to build up a model with known parameters and given initial conditions.
		
Outcome:
                After running main.m, MATLAB will open a figure window and plot the SIR model curve
